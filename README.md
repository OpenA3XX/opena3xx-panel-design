# üõ´ OpenA3XX: Panels, 3D Printed Components & Reference Archive

Welcome to the central repository for the OpenA3XX **Airbus cockpit build project**! This repository documents the design, construction, and references for all the cockpit panels and components, including 3D printed parts and photographic material used during development.

## ‚úàÔ∏è About the Project

As part of a long-term flight simulation setup, I'm building a **home Airbus cockpit replica**, focusing on authenticity, durability, and modularity. This project includes:

- Accurate panel layouts (e.g., ADIRS, FLT-CTL, etc.)
- Reference imagery from real cockpits
- 3D printed components (knobs, switch housings, structural parts)
- Design schematics, templates, and notes from real-world dimensions
- Documentation of tools and techniques used in building panels

This repository serves as a **knowledge base** and a **design vault** for other sim builders and enthusiasts who are building or planning to build their own Airbus home cockpit.
